    <p>There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest
        payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees,
        taxes, and insurance.[16] The costs to society include maintaining roads, land-use, road congestion, air
        pollution, noise pollution, public health, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. Traffic
        collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.[17] Personal benefits include on-demand
        transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience.[18] Societal benefits include economic benefits, such
        as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from
        leisure and travel opportunities, and the generation of revenue from taxation. People's ability to move flexibly
        from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.[19]</p>
